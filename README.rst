snippets
========
A collection of scripts and snippets which I found useful in my work.


bandwidth-monitor
-----------------
Prints the current bandwidth in Mbit/s or Gbits/s.



csv-to-kml
----------
A python script which reads a CSV (mostly from web scrapers) and then outputs a KML file. When possible, I try to import the CSV directly into my Geo-spatial tools (e.g. QGIS)



print-tree
----------
A python script to print file output, but in tree form. Replaced this with a bash script and placed in my local bin. Useful for python scripts which are scanning files and directories and require an output.



tcp
---
This directory contains a handful of TCP servers and a TCP client to test against them.



udp
---
This directory contains UDP servers and a UDP client.



web-scraping
------------
This is just a hello world / start of a web scraping script. All my other web scraping scripts are at home ;)
